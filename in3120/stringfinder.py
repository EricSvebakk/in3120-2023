class StringFinder:
    """
    Given a trie encoding a dictionary of strings, efficiently finds the subset of strings in the dictionary
    that are also present in a given text buffer. I.e., in a sense computes the "intersection" or "overlap"
    between the dictionary and the text buffer.

    Uses a trie-walk algorithm similar to the Aho-Corasick algorithm with some simplifications and some minor
    NLP extensions. The running time of this algorithm is virtually independent of the size of the dictionary,
    and linear in the length of the buffer we are searching in.

    The tokenizer we use when scanning the input buffer is assumed to be the same as the one that was used
    when adding strings to the trie.

        The matching dictionary entries, if any, are yielded back to the client as dictionaries having the
        keys "match" (str) and "range" (Tuple[int, int]).

        In a serious application we'd add more lookup/evaluation features, e.g., support for prefix matching,
        support for leftmost-longest matching (instead of reporting all matches), and support for lemmatization
