    Utility class for merging posting lists.

    in the returned postings when document identifiers overlap. Different
    approaches are possible, e.g., an arbitrary one of the two postings could
    be returned, or the posting having the smallest/largest term frequency, or
    a new one that produces an averaged value, or something else.
